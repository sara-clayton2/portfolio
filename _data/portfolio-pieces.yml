   id: zoo-app
   classification: UX/UI Design
   heading1: DEFINITION
   definition: "The purpose of this design is to create a user friendly mobile app for users to navigate through a zoo and find information about animals and events."
   heading2: PROCESS
   process: "In order to create content for the app I created a flow chart about a persons experience at the zoo, I focused mainly on pain points the user would come across and how they could be resolved. After narrowing down three main pain points I created personas of potential people who would be using this app and content that would increase the users experience. I wireframed content and created a flow chart in Illustrator of the apps interaction. The wireframe was brought into invision where I was able to test the app to ensure a positive user experience."
   heading3: ART DIRECTION
   artdirection: "I created a mood board with the main target audiance being families that love the outdoors and wildlife. My typography was going to be the standard Roboto in order for users to easily read content. I wanted to create small icons to be used for the animal sections that way all ages can easily identify the content. I created a color pallet that would resemble an outdoor theme using greens, browns and blues."

   id: kode
   classification: HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
   heading1: DEFINITION
   definition: "An interactive and responsive website for kids to learn the basics of html and css and how it can be applied to create their own website."
   heading2: PROCESS
   process: "I started to research and write the content I wanted to address in the website and format it into content that could be easily understood by children who have little or no experience in coding. After, I produced a variety of sketches to layout my information and how I wanted the content to be graphically designed, as well as taking into consideration designing for different devices. Using html, css and javascript I coded a responsive website with interactive content that would engage kids and explain the basics of coding."
   heading3: ART DIRECTION
   artdirection: "This website is based around teaching youth to code. To make the website attractive for youth I created a color pallet of bright blues and yellows. To keep consistent with the theme I thought it would be a fun and educational way of teaching code by using illustrated images. The font was all sans serif because of the age demographic and small paragraphs. All visuals and content are fun, bubbly and energetic but are clean and flat designs to focus mainly on content."

All content is completely responsive and has accessability features. It is a single page website for easy flow and to ensure the user can accompany both content together."

   id: weatherwear
   classification: UX / UI DESIGN
   heading1: DEFINITION
   definition: "WeatherWear is a mobile app that connects the user to the local weather forecast and offers suggestions of comfortable and appropriate wardrobe choices for that day."
   heading2: PROCESS
   process: "In order to create content for the app, I created a flow chart about a persons experience and pain points for waking up and finding an approprite wardrobe choice while guessing how their decision in clothing will impact them during the changing tempatures throught the day. To resolve this issue I began gathering content that would help the user with these pain points. In Illustrator I created a flow chart and wireframe of my app which was later tested in Invision. I also did usability testing where a group of peers and myself tested the interaction of the app to ensure all content had a nice flow and could properly be obtained."
   heading3: ART DIRECTION
   artdirection: "When you think weather you have a different reaction depending on if the day is bright and sunny or dull and rainy. When creating the color pallet for this weather app I wanted to relate content and emotions with colors. All users are visual and having the various colors associate with its content creates a good experience ( eg: sunny with yellows, rainy with greys, cloudy with blues )."

-  title: Learning Touch Canada
   id: learning-touch-canada
   classification: UX / UI DESIGN
   heading1: DEFINITION
   definition: "Re-design for a Windows app called Learning Touch Canada an education app where users learn to identify the flags, capital cities, provinces and territories of Canada with a set of simple matching games."
   heading2: PROCESS
   process: "Learning Touch Canada has a successful interaction and user experience; being rated a 4/5 star on the Microsoft Store. The app was designed with minimal graphic styles and color palletes. Knowing the creator of the app I was able to speak with him about the direction and vision he had for the design and content layout. After gathering primary research I was able to branch out and look at other successful Windows apps and collect popular and trending graphic styles and layouts that were successfully interpreting data while creating a clean and beautiful design."
   heading3: ART DIRECTION
   artdirection: "The content for this app is educational and having a large amount of iconography, colors and images would take away from the important information. I decided to steer clear of anything distruptive or distractive by keeping my color pallet simple of just red tones and having any icons used, as a flat design. All flags were converted to illustrated images and I decided to restylize the map into a more attractive design."
