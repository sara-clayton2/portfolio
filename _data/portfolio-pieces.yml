   heading2: BRAND ANALYSIS
   process: "I created a few mood boards that would help represent the look and feel of who City Folk are and the energy the festival brings. City Folk is a very lively, community oriented, family-friendly, culturally diverse festival that has a loud standing for all festival goers."
   heading3:  WIREFRAMES
   artdirection: "I wanted content to be blunt-force up front as soon as a user loaded the homepage. The new brand needed to be prominent and excite users to get ready for a new change. There needed to be a simplicity to the pages to make content easy for users to find and gather quickly. Having hilighted artists and bands would be prominent to excite viewer to attend. "
