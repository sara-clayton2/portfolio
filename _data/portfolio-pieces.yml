   heading3:  WORKFLOW
   artdirection: "This project started with competitive research analysis and mapping a user flow chart with clear user objectives – to discover new species of birds and identify birds. Low-fidelity interactive prototypes were then tested on user-groups using InVision, before the final high-fidelity mockups were produced."
